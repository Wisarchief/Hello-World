# Hello-World
Tutorial
I am an old school site builder, self taught, but gave up as things got too crazy in the coding world for my life. Times change and so do we right, so here I am after my son who is a code bootcamp sent me a link to Free Code Camp and I thought why not give it a try because I have always loved programming since my first college days when Fortran was in - dear god - so I am plunging into this to see if I have enough IQ left to keep up with the new gen and reacquire my goal of programming for a living.
